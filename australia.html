            <h5>There are only 2 countries. Australia is the smallest continent but the largest island in the world. It is home to unique wildlife, such as kangaroos, koalas, and platypuses. The country boasts the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system. About 70% of its land is covered by deserts, making the Outback a defining feature. Interestingly, Australia has no active volcanoes. It is also home to the world's oldest continuous culture, with Aboriginal Australians having lived there for over 65,000 years. There are more sheep than people in Australia, 
                and it has the world's longest fence, the 5,614 km Dingo Fence. With over 10,000 beaches, visiting one per day would take nearly 30 years.</h5>

        <p>New Zealand is NOT part of the Australian continent, but it belongs to the broader region of Oceania.
            New Zealand is not part of the Australian continent because of geological, geographical, and tectonic differences. Instead, New Zealand is part of the Zealandia continent, which is mostly submerged underwater</p>

        <summary>Why??</summary>
        <ul>
            <h3>1. Geological Differences</h3>
            <li>The Australian continent sits on the Australian tectonic plate, which includes Australia, Papua New Guinea, and part of Indonesia.</li>
            <li>New Zealand sits on a separate Zealandia tectonic plate, which is mostly submerged in the Pacific Ocean.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>2. Distance and Separation</h3>
            <li>New Zealand is more than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea.</li>
            <li>The deep ocean trench between them marks a clear separation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>3. Zealandia â€“ The Hidden Continent</h3>
            <li>New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a mostly submerged continent that was fully recognized by geologists in recent years.</li>
            <li>Zealandia was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana before breaking apart.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>4. Cultural and Political Identity</h3>
            <li>While New Zealand and Australia are both part of Oceania and have strong historical ties, they are independent nations with distinct identities.</li>
            <li>They share close economic, military, and diplomatic relations but remain separate geographically.</li>
        </ul>
